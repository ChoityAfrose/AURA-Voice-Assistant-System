# AURA-Voice-Assistant-System

**AURA** is an intelligent Python-based AI voice assistant built to simplify your daily digital interactions. Powered by speech recognition and natural text-to-speech responses, AURA provides a fully hands-free experience—allowing you to control your computer, retrieve information, and perform tasks using just your voice.

It listens actively, understands user commands, and responds in a natural, conversational manner—making your workflow smoother, faster, and more enjoyable.

**AURA** aims to combine the functionality of modern AI assistants with the interactive feel of fictional systems like JARVIS, creating a responsive and customizable assistant that you can expand with new features over time.
